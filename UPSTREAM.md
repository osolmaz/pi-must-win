The review covered every file in the upstream package directory:

```text
AGENTS.md
CHANGELOG.md
LICENSE
README.md
index.ts
lib/commit.test.ts
lib/commit.ts
lib/index.test.ts
package.json
```

The package has no runtime dependencies. Its only package script runs Vitest. Runtime behavior is
limited to creating and deleting a temporary hook directory and prefixing Pi agent `bash` calls with
process-local Git configuration and trailer values. It does not access the network, credentials,
provider requests, trust decisions, or background services.

Local changes turn the source into the first feature of the standalone `pi-must-win` extension.
Environment variables and temporary paths use the new package name. Trailer values are normalized
to one line, hook failures are fail-closed, and tests enforce the repository quality gate. The
`Generated-By` trailer also links to pi.dev. The session-scoped hook design remains unchanged.
